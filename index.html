    <sup>1</sup>That which must came to pass. The rain came and trees and grass
grew. What exists now is the process that began all those periods

current state was not predicted but came necessarily. The future is
not yet understood. Something not predicated may come to pass.

    moved to return good air. The plumbing and electrical work also gave comfort.
